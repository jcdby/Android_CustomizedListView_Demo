# Structrue of Source Code
1.There are 5 classes besides MainActivity.java. They are WifiInformation,WifiListAdapter,WifiNameModifier,WifiSecurity,WifiState, respectively.
#WifiInformation
  As mentioned at start, this is a simple one-activity app showing a list of wifi information. So, here, I abstract wifi infromation into WifiInformation class.In this class, it includs wifiName of String type, wifiState and kinOfSecurity of int type, and isBlocked of boolean type.
  wifiName shows the name of each wifi deviceï¼ŒwifiState shows intensity of each wifi device, kindOfSecurity shows their security police, isBlocked shows if it is blocked or not.
  Also, in this class, it includes getter and setter functions.

#WifiListAdapter
  WifiListAdapter is a subclass of ArrayAdatper, that is because ArrayAdapter  is too simple to show complex views. So, here i chose to extends ArrayAdapter. 
  WifiListAdapter has a list of WifiInformation objects. The important thing is that we have to override the getView method inherited from ArrayAdapter.This method is a rendering method that is in charge of getting the souce data showing on the view, structurely.
